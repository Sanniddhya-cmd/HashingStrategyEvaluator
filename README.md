# HashingStrategyEvaluator
A Java-based hashing algorithm evaluator that systematically tests 14 distinct hashing configurations using division and student-defined hash functions, with linear probing, quadratic probing, and chaining strategies. Includes performance metrics such as collisions, comparisons, and load factor for each configuration.
